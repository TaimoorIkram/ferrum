//! This module where all the commands are stored.
//! 
//! For now I have decided to keep separately two types of commands in this same module.
//! - SQLParser: Functionality relating to SQL execution and processing.
//! - CLIParser: Functionality related to the CLI, like help and other commands.
//! 
//! This may change if I give it more though.
